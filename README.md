### Brain structure tree generator
The repository stores the script to generate the brain structure tree of the human central nervous system from the wikipedia page on [list of regions in the human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain).

Scripts to generate from other sources may be added in the future.
